### 1 ) What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) ?

**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around **objects** rather than functions and logic. An object is a self-contained unit that consists of:

1. **Attributes (Properties)**: Data that describes the object.
2. **Methods (Functions)**: Actions or behaviors the object can perform.

OOP is based on four main principles:

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (object) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
2. **Inheritance**: Allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
3. **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexibility and dynamic behavior.
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object.

---

### Benefits of Using OOP

1. **Code Reusability**:
   - Through inheritance, you can reuse existing code, reducing duplication and improving efficiency.
   - Example: In Flutter, you can create a base `Widget` class and extend it for specific use cases.

2. **Modularity**:
   - Objects are self-contained, making it easier to maintain and update code.
   - Example: In Flutter, you can create reusable components (widgets) like buttons, cards, etc.

3. **Scalability**:
   - OOP makes it easier to manage and scale large applications by breaking them into smaller, manageable objects.

4. **Maintainability**:
   - Encapsulation ensures that changes to one part of the code don’t affect other parts, making debugging and maintenance easier.

5. **Abstraction**:
   - Simplifies complex systems by exposing only necessary details.
   - Example: In Flutter, you don’t need to know how a `Text` widget renders text; you just use it.

6. **Polymorphism**:
   - Allows flexibility in code by enabling objects to take on multiple forms.
   - Example: In Flutter, you can use a `ListView` to display different types of widgets (text, images, etc.).

7. **Improved Collaboration**:
   - OOP makes it easier for teams to work on different parts of an application simultaneously.

---

### OOP in Flutter

As a Flutter developer, you’re already using OOP concepts extensively. Flutter is built around widgets, which are essentially objects. Here’s how OOP applies in Flutter:

1. **Widgets as Objects**:
   - Every widget in Flutter (e.g., `Container`, `Text`, `Row`, `Column`) is a class that encapsulates properties and methods.

2. **Inheritance**:
   - Flutter widgets often extend other widgets. For example, `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget` are base classes that you extend to create custom widgets.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - Widgets encapsulate their internal logic and expose only the necessary properties (e.g., `color`, `child`, `padding`).

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - You can pass different types of widgets to a `child` property, and Flutter will handle them appropriately.

5. **Abstraction**:
   - Flutter abstracts away the complexity of rendering and layout, allowing you to focus on building the UI.

---

### Example of OOP in Flutter

```dart
// Encapsulation and Abstraction
class CustomButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;

  CustomButton({required this.text, required this.onPressed});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: onPressed,
      child: Text(text),
    );
  }
}

// Inheritance
class CustomIconButton extends CustomButton {
  final IconData icon;

  CustomIconButton({
    required String text,
    required VoidCallback onPressed,
    required this.icon,
  }) : super(text: text, onPressed: onPressed);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton.icon(
      onPressed: onPressed,
      icon: Icon(icon),
      label: Text(text),
    );
  }
}

// Polymorphism
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            CustomButton(
              text: "Click Me",
              onPressed: () => print("Button Pressed!"),
            ),
            CustomIconButton(
              text: "Icon Button",
              onPressed: () => print("Icon Button Pressed!"),
              icon: Icons.star,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  ));
}
```

### Notes for Flutter Developers

1. **Widgets are Classes**:
   - Always think of widgets as classes and leverage OOP principles to create reusable and maintainable components.

2. **State Management**:
   - Use OOP to encapsulate state logic in classes (e.g., `ChangeNotifier`, `Provider`, `Bloc`).

3. **Custom Widgets**:
   - Create custom widgets by extending `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` to encapsulate UI logic.

4. **DRY Principle**:
   - Avoid code duplication by reusing widgets and logic through inheritance and composition.

5. **Testing**:
   - OOP makes it easier to write unit tests for individual components.

---

By embracing OOP in Flutter, you can build scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications. It’s a fundamental concept that will help you write cleaner and more organized code.

### What is a Compile-Time Error?

A **compile-time error** occurs when the code is being compiled (i.e., converted from source code to machine code). These errors are detected by the compiler before the program is executed. They usually result from syntax mistakes, type mismatches, or violations of language rules.

#### Examples of Compile-Time Errors in Dart/Flutter:

1. **Syntax Error**:
   - Missing semicolon, parenthesis, or curly braces.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     print("Hello, World") // Missing semicolon
   }
   ```
   **Error**: `Expected ';' after this.`

2. **Type Mismatch**:
   - Assigning a value of the wrong type to a variable.
   ```dart
   int number = "Hello"; // Assigning a String to an int variable
   ```
   **Error**: `A value of type 'String' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'int'.`

3. **Undefined Variable or Method**:
   - Using a variable or method that hasn't been declared.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     print(undefinedVariable); // Variable not defined
   }
   ```
   **Error**: `The name 'undefinedVariable' isn't defined.`

4. **Missing Required Arguments**:
   - Not providing required parameters to a function or constructor.
   ```dart
   void greet(String name) {
     print("Hello, $name");
   }

   void main() {
     greet(); // Missing argument
   }
   ```
   **Error**: `The argument type 'Null' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'String'.`

5. **Incorrect Widget Usage**:
   - Using a widget incorrectly in Flutter.
   ```dart
   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         body: Center(
           child: Text(123), // Passing an int instead of a String
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```
   **Error**: `The argument type 'int' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'String'.`

---

### What is a Runtime Error?

A **runtime error** occurs while the program is running (after compilation). These errors are not detected by the compiler and often result from logical mistakes, invalid operations, or unexpected conditions (e.g., null values, out-of-bounds access).

#### Examples of Runtime Errors in Dart/Flutter:

1. **Null Reference Error**:
   - Accessing a property or method on a null object.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     String? name;
     print(name.length); // Accessing length on a null value
   }
   ```
   **Error**: `NoSuchMethodError: The getter 'length' was called on null.`

2. **Division by Zero**:
   - Attempting to divide a number by zero.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     int a = 10;
     int b = 0;
     print(a ~/ b); // Integer division by zero
   }
   ```
   **Error**: `IntegerDivisionByZeroException`

3. **Out-of-Bounds Access**:
   - Accessing an index that doesn't exist in a list.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3];
     print(numbers[5]); // Index out of range
   }
   ```
   **Error**: `RangeError (index): Index out of range`

4. **Invalid Cast**:
   - Trying to cast an object to an incompatible type.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     Object text = "Hello";
     int number = text as int; // Invalid cast
   }
   ```
   **Error**: `type 'String' is not a subtype of type 'int' in type cast`

5. **Flutter-Specific Runtime Errors**:
   - Using a `Future` without awaiting it.
   ```dart
   Future<String> fetchData() async {
     await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
     return "Data";
   }

   void main() {
     String data = fetchData(); // Forgot to await the Future
     print(data);
   }
   ```
   **Error**: `type 'Future<String>' is not a subtype of type 'String'`

### Key Differences Between Compile-Time and Runtime Errors

| **Aspect**            | **Compile-Time Error**                          | **Runtime Error**                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **When it occurs**     | During compilation (before the program runs).  | During execution (after the program runs). |
| **Detection**          | Detected by the compiler.                      | Not detected by the compiler.              |
| **Causes**             | Syntax errors, type mismatches, etc.           | Logical errors, null values, etc.          |
| **Examples**           | Missing semicolon, incorrect type usage.       | Null reference, division by zero.          |
| **Fix**                | Fix the code before running.                   | Debug and handle exceptions.               |

---

### How to Handle Runtime Errors in Dart/Flutter

1. **Null Safety**:
   - Use Dart's null safety feature to avoid null reference errors.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     String? name;
     print(name?.length ?? "Name is null"); // Safe access
   }
   ```

2. **Try-Catch Blocks**:
   - Use `try-catch` to handle exceptions gracefully.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     try {
       int a = 10;
       int b = 0;
       print(a ~/ b);
     } catch (e) {
       print("Error: $e");
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Assertions**:
   - Use `assert` to catch logical errors during development.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     int age = -5;
     assert(age >= 0, "Age cannot be negative");
   }
   ```

4. **Flutter Error Handling**:
   - Use `ErrorWidget` or `FlutterError.onError` to handle errors in Flutter apps.
   ```dart
   void main() {
     FlutterError.onError = (details) {
       print("Flutter error: ${details.exception}");
     };
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

---

By understanding and handling compile-time and runtime errors effectively, you can build more robust and reliable Dart/Flutter applications.

### Difference Between **Authentication** and **Authorization**

| **Aspect**              | **Authentication**                                                                 | **Authorization**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | Verifies **who you are**.                                                         | Determines **what you can do**.                                                  |
| **Purpose**              | Confirms the identity of a user or system.                                         | Grants or restricts access to resources based on permissions.                    |
| **When it Occurs**       | Happens first, during login or access attempts.                                    | Happens after successful authentication.                                         |
| **Example**              | Logging in with a username and password.                                          | Checking if a user has permission to view a specific page or perform an action.  |
| **Methods**              | - Passwords<br>- Biometrics (fingerprint, face recognition)<br>- OTPs             | - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)<br>- Permissions<br>- Access Control Lists (ACL) |
| **Focus**                | Identity verification.                                                            | Access control.                                                                  |
| **Outcome**              | Grants access to the system.                                                      | Grants access to specific resources or actions.                                  |


### Summary

- **Authentication**: Verifies identity (e.g., login).
- **Authorization**: Grants or restricts access (e.g., role-based permissions).
- Both are essential for building secure and functional applications, especially in Flutter apps that interact with backend services.

### Whats is Solid Priciples | Benifts ?

The **SOLID principles** are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers create more maintainable, scalable, and flexible software. These principles are particularly useful when building applications in frameworks like **Flutter**, where clean and modular code is essential for managing complex UIs and state.

Here’s an explanation of each SOLID principle, its benefits, and an example in the context of Flutter:

---

### 1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
- **Benefit**: Improves readability, maintainability, and makes debugging easier.
- **Example in Flutter**:
  - Instead of having a single widget handle both UI rendering and business logic, separate them.
  ```dart
  // Bad: A widget handling both UI and logic
  class UserProfile extends StatelessWidget {
    void fetchUserData() {
      // Fetch data from API
    }

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Text('User Profile');
    }
  }

  // Good: Separate UI and logic
  class UserProfile extends StatelessWidget {
    final UserService userService;

    UserProfile({required this.userService});

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return FutureBuilder(
        future: userService.fetchUserData(),
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          return Text('User Profile');
        },
      );
    }
  }
  ```

---

### 2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Benefit**: Reduces the risk of introducing bugs when adding new features.
- **Example in Flutter**:
  - Use inheritance or composition to extend functionality without modifying existing code.
  ```dart
  // Base class
  abstract class Shape {
    Widget render();
  }

  // Extend without modifying the base class
  class Circle extends Shape {
    @override
    Widget render() {
      return Container(
        width: 50,
        height: 50,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          shape: BoxShape.circle,
          color: Colors.blue,
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  class Square extends Shape {
    @override
    Widget render() {
      return Container(
        width: 50,
        height: 50,
        color: Colors.red,
      );
    }
  }
  ```

---

### 3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Definition**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- **Benefit**: Ensures that derived classes extend the base class without changing its behavior.
- **Example in Flutter**:
  - Ensure that subclasses of a widget can be used interchangeably with the base widget.
  ```dart
  // Base widget
  class CustomButton extends StatelessWidget {
    final VoidCallback onPressed;

    CustomButton({required this.onPressed});

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: onPressed,
        child: Text('Click Me'),
      );
    }
  }

  // Subclass that adheres to LSP
  class CustomIconButton extends CustomButton {
    final IconData icon;

    CustomIconButton({required VoidCallback onPressed, required this.icon})
        : super(onPressed: onPressed);

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return ElevatedButton.icon(
        onPressed: onPressed,
        icon: Icon(icon),
        label: Text('Click Me'),
      );
    }
  }
  ```
The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** ensures that **derived classes (subclasses)** extend the **base class (superclass)** without **changing its behavior**. However, if a subclass violates LSP, it can indeed change the behavior of the base class in ways that break the program. Let’s explore **how a subclass can change the behavior of the base class** and how this violates LSP.

---

### How a Subclass Can Change Behavior (and Violate LSP)

A subclass can change the behavior of the base class in the following ways:

1. **Weakening Preconditions**:
   - The subclass allows inputs that the base class would reject.
   - Example: A subclass accepts invalid or unexpected inputs, leading to incorrect behavior.

2. **Strengthening Postconditions**:
   - The subclass produces outputs that violate the expectations of the base class.
   - Example: A subclass returns values outside the expected range or format.

3. **Throwing New Exceptions**:
   - The subclass throws exceptions that the base class does not throw.
   - Example: A subclass introduces new error conditions that the base class doesn’t handle.

4. **Changing the Logic**:
   - The subclass overrides a method in a way that changes the core logic of the base class.
   - Example: A subclass implements a method incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.

5. **Ignoring Invariants**:
   - The subclass violates invariants (rules) that the base class relies on.
   - Example: A subclass modifies internal state in a way that breaks the assumptions of the base class.

---

### Example: Violating LSP by Changing Behavior

Let’s use a **Flutter example** to demonstrate how a subclass can change the behavior of the base class and violate LSP.

#### Base Class: `Shape`
```dart
abstract class Shape {
  double area();
}
```

#### Subclass 1: `Rectangle` (Adheres to LSP)
```dart
class Rectangle extends Shape {
  final double width;
  final double height;

  Rectangle({required this.width, required this.height});

  @override
  double area() {
    return width * height;
  }
}
```

#### Subclass 2: `Circle` (Adheres to LSP)
```dart
class Circle extends Shape {
  final double radius;

  Circle({required this.radius});

  @override
  double area() {
    return 3.14 * radius * radius;
  }
}
```

#### Subclass 3: `Triangle` (Violates LSP)
```dart
class Triangle extends Shape {
  final double base;
  final double height;

  Triangle({required this.base, required this.height});

  @override
  double area() {
    // Incorrect implementation: Forgot to divide by 2
    return base * height; // This violates LSP
  }
}
```

---

### How `Triangle` Changes Behavior
1. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The `Triangle` class incorrectly calculates the area by forgetting to divide by 2. This changes the behavior of the `area()` method, violating the contract of the base class.

2. **Unexpected Output**:
   - If the base class expects the area to be calculated correctly, the `Triangle` subclass produces an incorrect result, breaking the program’s logic.

---

### Usage in Flutter
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create a list of shapes
    final shapes = [
      Rectangle(width: 10, height: 20),
      Circle(radius: 5),
      Triangle(base: 10, height: 10), // This violates LSP
    ];

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('LSP Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: shapes.map((shape) {
              return Text(
                'Area: ${shape.area()}',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
              );
            }).toList(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

---

### Output
The app will display:
```
Area: 200.0  (Rectangle)
Area: 78.5   (Circle)
Area: 100.0  (Triangle - Incorrect)
```

---

### Why This Violates LSP
1. **Behavioral Change**:
   - The `Triangle` subclass changes the behavior of the `area()` method by returning an incorrect value.

2. **Breaks Expectations**:
   - The base class `Shape` expects the `area()` method to return the correct area of the shape. The `Triangle` subclass violates this expectation.

3. **Program Incorrectness**:
   - If the program relies on the correct calculation of the area, the `Triangle` subclass will cause the program to behave incorrectly.

---

### Correct Implementation of `Triangle`
To adhere to LSP, the `Triangle` class must correctly implement the `area()` method:
```dart
class Triangle extends Shape {
  final double base;
  final double height;

  Triangle({required this.base, required this.height});

  @override
  double area() {
    return (base * height) / 2; // Correct implementation
  }
}
```

Now, the program will work correctly with `Triangle` as well.

---

### Summary of How Subclasses Can Change Behavior
1. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - Overriding methods with incorrect implementations.
2. **Unexpected Outputs**:
   - Producing outputs that violate the expectations of the base class.
3. **New Exceptions**:
   - Introducing new error conditions that the base class doesn’t handle.
4. **Violating Invariants**:
   - Breaking rules or assumptions that the base class relies on.

By adhering to LSP, you ensure that subclasses extend the base class **without changing its behavior**, maintaining the correctness and reliability of the program.
---

### 4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Benefit**: Reduces the complexity of classes and avoids unnecessary dependencies.
- **Example in Flutter**:
  - Instead of having a single large interface, break it into smaller, more specific interfaces.
  ```dart
  // Bad: A single interface with multiple responsibilities
  abstract class Animal {
    void eat();
    void fly();
    void swim();
  }

  // Good: Segregated interfaces
  abstract class Eatable {
    void eat();
  }

  abstract class Flyable {
    void fly();
  }

  abstract class Swimmable {
    void swim();
  }

  class Bird implements Eatable, Flyable {
    @override
    void eat() {
      print('Bird is eating');
    }

    @override
    void fly() {
      print('Bird is flying');
    }
  }
  ```

---

### 5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Benefit**: Promotes loose coupling and makes the system easier to test and maintain.
- **Example in Flutter**:
  - Use dependency injection to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
  ```dart
  // Abstraction
  abstract class DataRepository {
    Future<String> fetchData();
  }

  // Low-level module
  class ApiRepository implements DataRepository {
    @override
    Future<String> fetchData() async {
      // Fetch data from API
      return 'Data from API';
    }
  }

  // High-level module
  class DataService {
    final DataRepository repository;

    DataService({required this.repository});

    Future<String> getData() async {
      return await repository.fetchData();
    }
  }

  // Usage in Flutter
  void main() {
    final dataService = DataService(repository: ApiRepository());
    runApp(MyApp(dataService: dataService));
  }
  ```

The term **"concrete implementation"** refers to a **specific, actual implementation** of an **abstraction** (such as an interface or abstract class). It is the "real" code that performs the actual work, as opposed to the abstract definition that only describes **what** should be done, not **how** it should be done.

Let’s break this down further:

---

### 1. **Abstraction**
An abstraction defines a **contract** or **blueprint** for what a class should do, but it doesn’t provide the actual implementation. Examples of abstractions include:
- **Interfaces** (in languages like Dart, Java, or C#)
- **Abstract classes** (in object-oriented programming)

For example:
```dart
abstract class AuthRepository {
  Future<bool> login(String email, String password);
  Future<bool> register(String email, String password);
}
```
Here, `AuthRepository` is an abstraction. It defines **what** methods should exist (`login` and `register`), but it doesn’t specify **how** they should work.

---

### 2. **Concrete Implementation**
A concrete implementation is a **real, working class** that provides the actual logic for the methods defined in the abstraction. It "fills in the details" of how the methods should behave.

For example:
```dart
class ApiAuthRepository implements AuthRepository {
  @override
  Future<bool> login(String email, String password) async {
    // Actual implementation: Call an API to log in
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1)); // Simulate network delay
    return true; // Assume login is successful
  }

  @override
  Future<bool> register(String email, String password) async {
    // Actual implementation: Call an API to register
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1)); // Simulate network delay
    return true; // Assume registration is successful
  }
}
```
Here, `ApiAuthRepository` is a **concrete implementation** of the `AuthRepository` abstraction. It provides the actual logic for the `login` and `register` methods.

---

### 3. **Another Example of Concrete Implementation**
Suppose you have another way to authenticate users, such as using a local database

### Summary of Benefits in Flutter:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Makes widgets and classes easier to test and maintain.
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Allows for easy addition of new features without modifying existing code.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Ensures consistency when using inheritance or polymorphism.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle**: Reduces complexity and avoids unnecessary dependencies.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Promotes loose coupling and improves testability.

By applying these principles in Flutter, you can create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code, which is especially important for large-scale applications.

Absolutely! Let’s dive deeper into **dependency injection (DI)** and how it allows you to **depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations**. This is a key concept in writing clean, modular, and testable code, especially in frameworks like Flutter.

---

### 5 ) What is Dependency Injection (DI)?
Dependency Injection is a design pattern where the **dependencies** of a class (e.g., services, repositories, etc.) are **provided from the outside** rather than being created internally. This makes the class more flexible, testable, and decoupled from specific implementations.

---

### Why Depend on Abstractions?
When you depend on **abstractions** (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes) instead of **concrete implementations**, you:
1. **Decouple your code**: High-level modules don’t need to know about the details of low-level modules.
2. **Improve testability**: You can easily replace dependencies with mocks or stubs during testing.
3. **Increase flexibility**: You can switch implementations without modifying the dependent class.
4. **Follow the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

---

### Example: Dependency Injection with Abstractions in Flutter

Let’s use a **user authentication system** as an example. We’ll define an abstraction for authentication and inject different concrete implementations.

---

#### Step 1: Define the Abstraction
Create an abstract class (`AuthRepository`) that defines the contract for authentication.

```dart
abstract class AuthRepository {
  Future<bool> login(String email, String password);
  Future<bool> register(String email, String password);
}
```

---

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Implementations
Implement the abstraction with specific logic. For example:
- `ApiAuthRepository`: Authenticates via an API.
- `LocalAuthRepository`: Authenticates using a local database.

```dart
class ApiAuthRepository implements AuthRepository {
  @override
  Future<bool> login(String email, String password) async {
    // Simulate API call for login
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1)); // Simulate network delay
    return true; // Assume login is successful
  }

  @override
  Future<bool> register(String email, String password) async {
    // Simulate API call for registration
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1)); // Simulate network delay
    return true; // Assume registration is successful
  }
}

class LocalAuthRepository implements AuthRepository {
  @override
  Future<bool> login(String email, String password) async {
    // Simulate local authentication (e.g., SQLite)
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1)); // Simulate delay
    return true; // Assume login is successful
  }

  @override
  Future<bool> register(String email, String password) async {
    // Simulate local registration
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1)); // Simulate delay
    return true; // Assume registration is successful
  }
}
```

---

#### Step 3: Create the High-Level Module
The high-level module (`UserService`) depends on the abstraction (`AuthRepository`) rather than a concrete implementation.

```dart
class UserService {
  final AuthRepository authRepository;

  UserService({required this.authRepository});

  Future<bool> loginUser(String email, String password) async {
    return await authRepository.login(email, password);
  }

  Future<bool> registerUser(String email, String password) async {
    return await authRepository.register(email, password);
  }
}
```

---

#### Step 4: Inject the Dependency
Use dependency injection to provide the concrete implementation (`ApiAuthRepository` or `LocalAuthRepository`) to the `UserService`.

```dart
void main() {
  // Inject the concrete implementation
  final authRepository = ApiAuthRepository(); // Or LocalAuthRepository()
  final userService = UserService(authRepository: authRepository);

  runApp(MyApp(userService: userService));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final UserService userService;

  MyApp({required this.userService});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dependency Injection Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  final success = await userService.loginUser('test@example.com', 'password');
                  print('Login Success: $success');
                },
                child: Text('Login'),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  final success = await userService.registerUser('test@example.com', 'password');
                  print('Registration Success: $success');
                },
                child: Text('Register'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

---

### How This Works
1. **Abstraction**: `AuthRepository` defines the contract for authentication.
2. **Concrete Implementations**: `ApiAuthRepository` and `LocalAuthRepository` provide specific logic for authentication.
3. **High-Level Module**: `UserService` depends on the abstraction (`AuthRepository`), not the concrete implementation.
4. **Dependency Injection**: The concrete implementation is injected into `UserService` from the outside (e.g., in the `main` function).

---

### Benefits of Dependency Injection with Abstractions

#### 1. **Decoupling**
- The `UserService` doesn’t need to know about the details of how authentication works. It only knows about the `AuthRepository` interface.
- This makes the `UserService` more modular and easier to maintain.

#### 2. **Testability**
- You can easily test the `UserService` by injecting a mock implementation of `AuthRepository`.
- Example:
  ```dart
  class MockAuthRepository implements AuthRepository {
    @override
    Future<bool> login(String email, String password) async {
      return true; // Simulate successful login
    }

    @override
    Future<bool> register(String email, String password) async {
      return true; // Simulate successful registration
    }
  }

  void main() {
    test('UserService login test', () async {
      final mockAuthRepository = MockAuthRepository();
      final userService = UserService(authRepository: mockAuthRepository);

      final success = await userService.loginUser('test@example.com', 'password');
      expect(success, true);
    });
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Flexibility**
- You can switch between different implementations (e.g., `ApiAuthRepository` vs. `LocalAuthRepository`) without modifying the `UserService`.
- Example:
  ```dart
  void main() {
    // Switch between implementations
    final authRepository = LocalAuthRepository(); // Or ApiAuthRepository()
    final userService = UserService(authRepository: authRepository);

    runApp(MyApp(userService: userService));
  }
  ```

#### 4. **Scalability**
- Adding new authentication methods (e.g., Firebase, OAuth) is as simple as creating a new concrete implementation of `AuthRepository`.

---

### Summary
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: A pattern where dependencies are provided from the outside.
- **Abstractions**: Define contracts (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes) that describe what should be done.
- **Concrete Implementations**: Provide the actual logic for the abstractions.
- **Benefits**:
  - Decouples high-level and low-level modules.
  - Improves testability and flexibility.
  - Makes your code more modular and maintainable.

By using dependency injection to depend on abstractions, you can write code that is easier to test, maintain, and extend. This is especially important in large-scale Flutter applications where modularity and flexibility are key.
